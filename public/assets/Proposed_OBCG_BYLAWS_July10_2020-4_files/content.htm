In the event of ongoing harm creating an emergent situation threatening the Water System and the community, shut-off may be made without notice to the member.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If shut-off occurs, members have 90 days to file an appeal for service, provided all fees, costs and damages have been paid or repaired. After that period reconnection is not guaranteed, and no preference is given to members who have been disconnected for cause. Reconnection will be dependent on regulatory requirements including water rights, current pending requests, history of the account and other considerations by the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee reserves the right to hold the connection if the member submits a hardship letter and agrees to the terms of action as determined by the Executive Committee. “Hardship” may be due to illness or injury, change of employment status, loss of income, natural disasters, divorce, death or military</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deployment.
